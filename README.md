# Micro Army

This is a tool to quickly turn on some number of AWS micro instances and have them slam a webserver simultaneously. The micro's are effectively [Siege](http://www.joedog.org/index/siege-home) cannons.

Siege is a flexible load testing tool. You can configure different payloads and frequencies and all kinds of good stuff. So the trick for microarmy is to get Siege on a bunch of computers quickly and coordinate the micro instances to work in parallel. The micro instances are controlled via SSH in parallel, thanks to Eventlet + Paramiko.

After the micro's have finished, the output from each Siege instance is parsed to produce a CSV report.

## Example Use:

Here is roughly using micro army looks like.

    $ ./command_center.py 
    command :: help
      help:     This menu.
      quit:     RIP
      deploy:   Starts cannon initializations routines
      fire:     Asks for a url and then fires the cannons
    command :: deploy

## Requirements

There are only a few requirements. Everything required for the micro's is installed on the micro's, after all.

    $ pip install eventlet paramiko boto

## Config

You should create a local_settings.py inside the repo and fill in the following
keys. Look at `settings.py` for more information.

* aws_access_key
* aws_secret_key
* security_groups
* key_pair_name
* num_cannons
* ec2_ssh_key
